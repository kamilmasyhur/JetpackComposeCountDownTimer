## :scroll: Description
This app will be used only for tracking the time (countdown from given hour, minute, and second)

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
This is really awesome that we can code using kotlin, it being easier to maintain more things like:
1. State management
2. Render only happen on some changes state only

It's nice that I could learn this faster than what I think, but still need time to understand
more context of jetpack compose. I make this simple countdown timer in just one day and that awesome.
